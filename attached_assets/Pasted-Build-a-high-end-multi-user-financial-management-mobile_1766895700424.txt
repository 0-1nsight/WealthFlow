Build a high-end, multi-user financial management mobile application called EquiFinance. The core differentiator is Proportional Expense Splitting based on household income contribution, integrated with OCR receipt scanning and deep net worth tracking. The UI must be a "Glassmorphic" Dark Mode aesthetic with 60fps animations.1. Core Architecture & Tech StackFramework: React Native or Flutter (Cross-platform iOS/Android).Database: Local-first SQLite with SQLCipher encryption.Sync: Real-time cloud sync (Firebase/AWS) with offline-first capabilities and conflict resolution.Auth: Biometric (FaceID/TouchID) + JWT-based secure login.OCR: Integrated Google ML Kit for line-item receipt extraction.2. Functional RequirementsMulti-User & Splitting LogicHousehold Sync: Multiple users share one account; transactions are tagged by UserID.Proportional Split Formula: Automatically calculate shares based on income.Logic: $User Share = (\frac{User Income}{Total Household Income}) \times Total Expense$.Reconciliation: A "Who owes whom" view based on monthly shared spending.Transaction & BudgetingEntry: Manual entry + OCR Scanning. OCR must extract Merchant, Date, Total, and individual Line Items.Categorization: 25 default categories with ML-based auto-sorting.Safe-To-Spend: A real-time dashboard widget calculated as: $(Income - Fixed Expenses - Budget Allocations - Goal Savings) / Days until next payday$.Budgets: Category-specific, Payment-method-specific, and User-specific limits with "Rolling" (rollover) options.Advanced TrackingDebt & Net Worth: Track Assets (Cash, Investments, Property) vs. Liabilities (Credit, Loans).Debt Snowball: Visualization for debt payoff timelines and interest projections.Goals: Multi-milestone savings goals with "Projected Completion" dates.3. UI/UX & Design SystemTheme: Primary: Dark Mode (Deep Charcoal #121212). Accents: Electric Teal (#00B8D4) and Sunset Orange for alerts.Navigation: Bottom Tab Bar (Dashboard, Transactions, Budget, Goals, Settings).Interactions: * Micro-interactions for "Add Transaction" FAB (morphing animation).Smooth line charts using Skia or similar high-perf library.Haptic feedback on successful entry/milestone reach.Visuals: Neumorphic cards, blurred background glass effects, and skeleton loaders for data fetching.4. Data & ReportingExports: PDF (Monthly Professional Summaries) and CSV (Raw Data).Insights: Spending velocity indicators, unusual spending alerts (anomalous spikes), and savings rate gauges.5. Phased Development Instructions (Starting with MVP)Initialize: Setup navigation, local encrypted database, and auth screens.Core CRUD: Implement manual Income/Expense logging with user attribution.The Logic: Build the proportional split calculator and the "Safe-to-Spend" dashboard.Advanced: Integrate OCR scanning and Chart.js/D3 visualizations
